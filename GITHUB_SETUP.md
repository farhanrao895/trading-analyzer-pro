# 📦 GitHub Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `trading-analyzer-pro` (or any name you like)
3. **Description**: "AI-Powered Trading Chart Analyzer"
4. **Visibility**: Choose **Public** or **Private**
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have files)
6. **Click**: "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Project

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trading-analyzer-pro.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username!**
